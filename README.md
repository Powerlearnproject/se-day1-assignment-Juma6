#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with systematic design, development, testing, deployment and maintainance of software applications.
Software engineering plays critical role in technology advancement, in that it helps build reliable and scalable, secure and cost effective systems.
Advancement is the banking systems where it aid in seeless intergration with banking apps and chatbots.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)

This replaced unstructured, spaghetti code with modular programming techniques.
Introduced concepts like functions, loops, and control structures for better readability and maintenance.
Key figures: Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming as a best practice.
Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)

Introduced encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to improve code reusability and scalability.
Led to the development of languages like C++, Java, and Python.
Enabled software modeling through frameworks like UML.
Rise of Agile & DevOps (2000s-Present)

Shifted from rigid waterfall models to iterative, customer-focused development.
Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) improved collaboration and flexibility.
DevOps combined development and operations, enabling automation, CI/CD, and rapid deployment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Defines project scope, feasibility, budget, and resource allocation.
Requirement Analysis – Gathers and documents user and system requirements.
Design – Creates system architecture, UI/UX, and database structure.
Implementation (Coding) – Developers write, test, and integrate code.
Testing – Identifies and fixes bugs through unit, integration, and system testing.
Deployment – Releases the software for use in production environments.
Maintenance – Provides updates, bug fixes, and improvements post-deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology follows a sequential approach, where each phase (such as planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) is completed before moving to the next. It is structured and rigid, making it difficult to accommodate changes once development begins. Customer involvement is minimal after the initial requirement phase, and testing is done only at the end. This approach is best suited for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, such as developing a banking system that requires strict regulatory compliance and thorough documentation.

On the other hand, the Agile methodology is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous development and feedback. Unlike Waterfall, Agile enables ongoing collaboration with stakeholders, frequent testing, and incremental releases of the product. This makes it ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as mobile app development, where user feedback and market trends drive frequent updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
An IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for writing, editing, debugging, and testing code in one place. It enhances developer productivity by integrating essential development tools such as code editors, compilers, debuggers, and package managers.

Importance of IDEs:
Efficiency – Offers features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection to speed up development.
Debugging – Provides built-in debugging tools to identify and fix issues quickly.
Code Management – Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks within a single environment.
Integration – Connects with version control systems, databases, and cloud platforms for seamless development.
Examples of IDEs:

IntelliJ IDEA – Ideal for Java and Kotlin development.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – A lightweight, extensible IDE supporting multiple languages.
PyCharm – Optimized for Python development.

2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
A VCS is a tool that tracks and manages changes to source code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently, maintain code history, and revert to previous versions when needed.

Importance of VCS:
Collaboration – Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting changes.
History Tracking – Keeps a record of every modification, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if necessary.
Code Safety – Protects against accidental data loss and ensures backup of important code.
Branching & Merging – Supports working on different features simultaneously and merging them when ready.
Examples of VCS:
Git – The most widely used distributed VCS, commonly integrated with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
Apache Subversion (SVN) – A centralized VCS used in enterprise environments.
